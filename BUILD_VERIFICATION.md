# Build Verification Checklist

This document provides a checklist for verifying that the project builds successfully and passes all tests before transitioning to Phase 2.

## Pre-Build Checks

- [ ] All project files (.csproj) have appropriate version information
- [ ] All source files have standardized documentation headers
- [ ] No commented-out code or TODOs remaining in critical paths
- [ ] No redundant or unused code, imports, or references

## Build Process

Run the following commands in order:

```bash
# Clean the solution
dotnet clean DocumentManagementML.sln

# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build in Debug configuration
dotnet build --configuration Debug

# Build in Release configuration
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

## Test Execution

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage report
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
```

## Specific Validation Points

### Domain Layer
- [ ] All entity classes properly documented
- [ ] Repository interfaces fully defined
- [ ] Navigation properties correctly mapped

### Application Layer
- [ ] DTOs properly mapped to domain entities
- [ ] Services implement proper transaction handling
- [ ] Error handling and validation in place

### Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Repository implementations complete
- [ ] Transaction handling works across repositories
- [ ] Database context properly configured

### API Layer
- [ ] Controllers use appropriate DTOs
- [ ] Dependency injection properly configured
- [ ] Swagger documentation enabled

## Post-Build Artifacts

After a successful build, the following artifacts should be present:

- Debug binaries in `/bin/Debug/net9.0/` directories
- XML documentation files for API references
- Test result files from test execution

## Common Build Issues and Solutions

### Missing Package References
- Ensure all required packages are included in the project files
- Check for version conflicts in package references

### Entity Framework Core Issues
- Verify the InMemory provider is referenced in the API project
- Check for missing DbContext service registration

### Transaction Handling Issues
- Ensure DbContextTransaction properly implements ITransaction
- Verify transaction scope is properly managed

## Final Validation

Before transitioning to Phase 2, perform a final validation:

1. Run all unit tests and confirm they pass
2. Verify integration tests pass
3. Review code coverage reports (aim for >80% on core components)
4. Document any remaining warnings or issues

## Transition to Phase 2

Upon successful completion of Phase 1 build verification:

1. Tag the repository with `phase1-complete`
2. Update PROJECT.md to reflect 100% completion of Phase 1
3. Create a Phase 2 planning document with initial tasks
4. Set up tracking for Phase 2 development tasks
