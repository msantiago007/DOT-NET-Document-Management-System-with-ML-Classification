# DocumentManagementML Project Cost Estimation

## Overview

This document tracks the estimated development costs for the DocumentManagementML project across all phases. It provides transparency into the resource investment and helps with budget planning.

## Cost Tracking Methodology

We use the following approach to estimate costs:

1. **Time Tracking:** Hours spent on each phase are estimated based on complexity and scope
2. **Developer Rates:** We apply standard industry rates for .NET developers with ML expertise
3. **Regular Updates:** Estimates are updated at the end of each phase and periodically during development
4. **Actuals vs. Estimates:** Where possible, we track actual hours against estimates

## Rate Card (USD)

| Developer Level | Hourly Rate Range | Average Rate |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Junior Developer | $50 - $75 | $65 |
| Mid-level Developer | $75 - $125 | $100 |
| Senior Developer | $125 - $175 | $150 |
