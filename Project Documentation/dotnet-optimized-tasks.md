Key Changes Made:
1. Moved Infrastructure Setup to position #2
2. Positioned Document Processing Services before ML.NET Integration
3. Combined ML.NET Integration and Model Development into a single phase
4. Moved Security Implementation before Frontend Development
5. Positioned Frontend Development after security is in place
6. Kept System Administration and Documentation as final phases
7. Removed redundancies between phases

Notes:
- Each phase builds upon the previous phases
- Infrastructure and security are established early
- Core document processing is in place before ML features
- Frontend development occurs after backend stability
- Testing and documentation are continuous but formalized in final phases
