# DocumentManagementML Project Status

## Project Overview
DocumentManagementML is an on-premises document management system with intelligent document classification capabilities. The system will provide secure document storage, retrieval, versioning, and automated classification through ML.NET.

## Development Approach
We are following a phased development approach to ensure we have testable components at each stage:

### Phase 1: Core Domain Layer
- Essential domain entities (Document, DocumentType, DocumentMetadata, User)
- Repository interfaces and implementations
- Simple file storage service
- In-memory database configuration for testing

### Phase 2: Application Services Layer
- DTOs for core entities
- CRUD application services
- AutoMapper profiles
- Exception handling

### Phase 3: API Layer
- Controllers for document management
- API configuration
- Validation and error handling

### Phase 4: ML Implementation
- Document classification service
- Text extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Integration with document services

## Current Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Core Domain Layer

**Completed:**
- Initial project structure created with Clean Architecture
- Domain entities defined
- Repository interfaces defined
- Test projects set up

  - Fixed references to Data.Configurations namespace
  - Added Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package for Swagger support
  - Fixed ValidationException missing reference
  - Implemented missing methods in DocumentClassificationService

## Latest Session Summary (April 28, 2025)

In this session, we focused on getting the project to build successfully by implementing Phase 1 modifications:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Identified key issues causing build failures
   - Discovered missing implementations and interface mismatches
   - Mapped out dependencies between components

2. **Entity Updates**
   - Added `MetadataDictionary` property to the `Document` class to provide dictionary-style access to metadata
   - Added `Key` and `Value` properties to `DocumentMetadata` for easier access
   - Created `DocumentTypeScore` entity for storing classification scores

3. **ML Simplification**
   - Created a simplified `IDocumentClassificationService` interface with minimal methods
   - Implemented `SimpleDocumentClassificationService` as a placeholder that returns static data
   - Modified the main `DocumentClassificationService` to use the simple implementation

4. **DTO Improvements**
   - Created missing DTOs for document classification results
   - Fixed duplicate DTO definitions by identifying existing implementations
   - Updated the MLDTOs file to point to individual DTO implementations

5. **Build Progress**
   - Reduced build errors from 40+ to 21
   - Fixed all ML-related build errors
   - Remaining errors are related to transaction handling and repository methods

6. **Documentation**
   - Created PROJECT.md to document project status and development approach
   - Established a development process for future sessions
   - Documented build errors and fixes for better continuity

## Implementation Issues
We encountered several issues with the initial code:
1. Missing essential properties in the Document entity
2. Missing implementation for DocumentTypeScore
3. Transaction handling inconsistencies between ITransaction and IDbContextTransaction
4. Duplicate DTO definitions in different files
5. Interface methods that weren't implemented

## Implementation Notes
- Using .NET 9.0 (preview)
- Following Clean Architecture principles
- Using xUnit for testing
- Deferring ML features using ML.NET for later phases
- Using placeholder implementations for ML functionality

## Development Process for Future Sessions

To maintain consistency across sessions, we will follow this structured process:

### 1. Session Initialization
- At the beginning of each new session, review the PROJECT.md file first
- Check the current build status using `dotnet build`
- Identify the priority tasks based on "Next Steps" in PROJECT.md

### 2. Implementation Process
- **Planning Phase**
  - For each task, describe the proposed changes and functional implications before implementation
  - Get approval for the approach before making changes
  - Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
  
- **Development Phase**
  - Implement changes one component at a time
  - Focus on getting a clean build rather than adding new features
  - Document any deviations from the planned approach
  
- **Testing Phase**
  - After each significant change, run a build to verify progress
  - When appropriate, add unit tests for the implemented components

### 3. Session Conclusion
- When prompted with "End and summarize", update the PROJECT.md file with:
  - A summary of completed work
  - Updated "Current Status" section
  - Updated "Next Steps" section
  - The date of the update
  
- Run a final build to document the current build status

Note: Each session will conclude with the prompt "End and summarize" to initiate this process.

### 4. Version Control
- Make meaningful commits with descriptive messages
- For significant milestones, consider creating tags or branches

Following this process will ensure continuity between development sessions and provide clear documentation of our progress.

## Session Summary (April 28, 2025)

   - Added the missing `TypeName` property to the `DocumentType` entity
   - Updated the constructor to initialize the TypeName property with an empty string
   - Implemented proper handling of TypeName in DocumentTypeService
   - Added the missing `IsSuccessful` property to DocumentClassificationResult as an alias for backward compatibility

2. **Repository Enhancements**
   - Added the missing `GetActiveUsersCountAsync` method to the IUserRepository interface
   - Implemented the `GetActiveUsersCountAsync` method in UserRepository class
   - Fixed inconsistencies in the DocumentTypeService regarding TypeName property usage
   - Made IDocumentTypeRepository inherit from IRepository<DocumentType> to get transaction methods
   - Fixed method hiding warnings by adding the 'new' keyword to overridden methods

3. **Transaction Handling**
   - Fixed transaction handling inconsistencies between ITransaction and IDbContextTransaction
   - Updated all service classes to use ITransaction instead of IDbContextTransaction
   - Removed unnecessary using directives for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Storage

4. **Unit Tests**
   - Created unit tests for the DocumentType entity to ensure proper initialization
   - Added unit tests for DocumentTypeService to validate TypeName property handling
   - Set up test classes with proper mocking infrastructure
