# DocumentManagementML Project Status

## Recommended Session Start Prompt

To ensure continuity between sessions, please use the following prompt at the beginning of each new session:

```
Please review the project's current status by reading the PROJECT.md file in the Project Documentation directory. After reading it, let me know what you understand about the current state of the project, what phase we're in, and what the immediate next steps should be based on the documentation. Then we can proceed with implementing the highest priority tasks.
```

This prompt will ensure that each session begins with a clear understanding of the project's current state and priorities.

## Project Overview
DocumentManagementML is an on-premises document management system with intelligent document classification capabilities. The system will provide secure document storage, retrieval, versioning, and automated classification through ML.NET.

- Simple file storage service
- In-memory database configuration for testing

### Phase 2: Application Services Layer
- DTOs for core entities
- CRUD application services
- AutoMapper profiles
- Exception handling

### Phase 3: API Layer
- Controllers for document management
- API configuration
- Validation and error handling

### Phase 4: ML Implementation
- Document classification service

- Using xUnit for testing
- Deferring ML features using ML.NET for later phases
- Using placeholder implementations for ML functionality

## Development Process for Future Sessions

To maintain consistency across sessions, we will follow this structured process:

### 1. Session Initialization
- At the beginning of each new session, review the PROJECT.md file first
- Check the current build status using `dotnet build`
- Identify the priority tasks based on "Next Steps" in PROJECT.md
- Review the [Cost Estimation document](./COST_ESTIMATION.md) to understand budget implications

### 2. Implementation Process
- **Planning Phase**
  - For each task, describe the proposed changes and functional implications before implementation
  - Get approval for the approach before making changes
  - Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
  
- **Development Phase**
  - Implement changes one component at a time
  - Focus on getting a clean build rather than adding new features
  - Document any deviations from the planned approach
  
- **Testing Phase**
  - After each significant change, run a build to verify progress
  - When appropriate, add unit tests for the implemented components

### 3. Session Conclusion
- When prompted with "End and summarize", update the PROJECT.md file with:
  - A summary of completed work
  - Updated "Current Status" section
  - Updated "Next Steps" section
  - The date of the update
  
- Run a final build to document the current build status

Note: Each session will conclude with the prompt "End and summarize" to initiate this process.

### 4. Cost Tracking
- After completing major components or at the end of a phase, update the [COST_ESTIMATION.md](./COST_ESTIMATION.md) document
- Record the actual hours spent on each component
- Document any variance between estimated and actual costs
- Review cost implications before starting new major components
- Follow the detailed process in [COST_TRACKING_PROCESS.md](./COST_TRACKING_PROCESS.md)

### 5. Version Control
- Make meaningful commits with descriptive messages
- For significant milestones, consider creating tags or branches

Following this process will ensure continuity between development sessions, provide clear documentation of our progress, and maintain transparency regarding project costs.
