# Phase 2 Planning: Application Services Layer

This document outlines the plan for Phase 2 of the DocumentManagementML project, focusing on the Application Services Layer.

## Phase 2 Overview

The Application Services Layer serves as the bridge between the Domain Layer and the API Layer. It provides application-specific business logic, orchestrates domain entities, and manages application state. Phase 2 will focus on:

1. Completing the Application Service implementations
2. Implementing comprehensive DTOs for all domain entities
3. Setting up robust error handling and validation
4. Implementing proper transaction management

## Phase 2 Targets

**Target Start Date:** May 1, 2025
**Target Completion Date:** June 30, 2025
**Target Code Coverage:** 85%

## Key Components

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

- [ ] Complete remaining DTOs for all entities
- [ ] Add input validation attributes to all DTOs
- [ ] Implement proper mapping configurations
- [ ] Create response wrappers for standardized API responses

### Application Services

- [ ] Complete DocumentService implementation
- [ ] Complete UserService implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging to all service methods
- [ ] Implement field-level security and access control

### Transaction Management

- [ ] Implement Unit of Work pattern for transaction coordination
- [ ] Create service-level transaction handling
- [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Add transaction logging and monitoring

### Error Handling

- [ ] Implement global exception handling
- [ ] Create domain-specific exceptions
- [ ] Add exception translation to API responses
- [ ] Implement validation error collection and reporting

### Mapping

- [ ] Complete AutoMapper profiles for all entities
- [ ] Add custom value resolvers for complex mappings
- [ ] Implement projection mappings for queries
- [ ] Add unit tests for all mapping configurations

## Implementation Approach

### Incremental Development

Phase 2 will follow an incremental approach, with features implemented in the following order:

1. **Foundation Setup**
   - Complete remaining DTOs
   - Finish AutoMapper configuration
   - Implement Unit of Work pattern

2. **Service Implementation**
   - Implement core CRUD operations
   - Add transaction management
   - Implement validation

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Add advanced querying capabilities
   - Implement filtering and sorting
   - Add pagination support

4. **Integration and Testing**
   - Implement integration tests
   - Add performance tests
   - Document service interfaces

## Testing Strategy

Phase 2 will emphasize integration testing alongside unit testing:

- **Unit Tests** for application services focusing on business logic
- **Integration Tests** for services with repositories
- **Mock-based Tests** for external dependencies
- **Transaction Tests** for ensuring data consistency

## Dependencies

Phase 2 has the following dependencies:

- Successful completion of Phase 1 (Core Domain Layer)
- Entity Framework Core 9.0
- AutoMapper 12.0.1
- FluentValidation (to be added)

## Milestones

1. **Milestone 1: Foundation (May 15, 2025)**
   - DTOs and mapping configuration complete
   - Unit of Work pattern implemented
   - Basic service implementations working

2. **Milestone 2: Core Functionality (June 1, 2025)**
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Transaction management implemented
   - Error handling framework in place

3. **Milestone 3: Advanced Features (June 15, 2025)**
   - Advanced querying capabilities
   - Filtering and pagination
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Milestone 4: Completion (June 30, 2025)**
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation complete
   - Phase 2 review and sign-off

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex transaction management | High | Medium | Start with simple scenarios, build up to complex ones |
| Performance issues with large datasets | High | Medium | Implement paging, test with large datasets early |
| Complexity of mapping configurations | Medium | High | Write unit tests for all mapping scenarios |
| Integration with Domain Layer | Medium | Low | Ensure thorough testing of integration points |

## Definition of Done

Phase 2 will be considered complete when:

- All planned service implementations are complete and tested
- Code coverage for the Application Layer exceeds 85%
- All unit and integration tests pass
- Performance meets or exceeds benchmarks
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Next Steps

1. Finalize Phase 1 completion
2. Set up tracking for Phase 2 tasks
3. Begin implementation of foundational components
4. Schedule regular progress reviews
