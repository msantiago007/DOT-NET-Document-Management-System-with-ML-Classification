  - Added Swagger documentation

## Next Steps

### Service Layer
- âœ… Implement Enhanced User Service
  - Refactor existing user service to use Unit of Work pattern
  - Add proper transaction handling for user operations
  - Create comprehensive tests for user operations

- âœ… File Storage Service Enhancement
  - Implement robust file storage functionality
  - Add support for versioning
  - Add integration with document management

### Data Access Layer
- âœ… Add Pagination Support
  - Implement proper pagination across all repository methods
  - Add response metadata for frontend pagination
  - Create standardized request/response patterns for paged data

### API Layer
- âœ… Complete API Controller Refactoring
  - Refactor remaining controllers to use the base controller
  - Ensure consistent response formats across all endpoints
  - Add comprehensive validation

### Testing
- ðŸ”„ Implement Integration Tests (In Progress)
  - Create test fixtures for API testing
  - Implement controller integration tests
  - Test authentication and authorization flows
  - Validate transaction handling across services

## Accomplishments

The implementation of the Unit of Work pattern has significantly improved the transaction handling capabilities of the application. We now have a consistent pattern for handling related operations that span multiple repositories, ensuring data integrity.

The standardized response DTOs provide a consistent API contract, making it easier for clients to consume our services. The enhanced error handling and validation will improve the user experience by providing clear feedback on validation issues.

The base application service and controller abstractions have reduced code duplication and improved maintainability by centralizing common concerns like transaction handling, error management, and logging.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Ambiguous Validation Exception**: We encountered an ambiguity issue between our custom `ValidationException` and the system's `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException`. This was resolved by using fully qualified names or explicit references.

- **Interface Consistency**: We had to ensure that the enhanced service implementations fully respected their interfaces, requiring additional implementations for methods like pagination-enabled document type retrieval.

- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring proper transaction handling, especially in error scenarios, required careful implementation and extensive testing.

## Added Testing Infrastructure (May 1, 2025)

### Integration Testing Framework
- Created WebApplicationFactory-based test fixture for API testing
- Setup in-memory database configuration with test data seeding
- Implemented authentication helpers for secured endpoint testing
- Created comprehensive test documentation

### Test Implementation
- Basic API connectivity tests are working
- Added controller-specific test templates
- Created authentication flow tests
- Prepared structure for testing document and document type operations

### Testing Challenges
- DTO property naming mismatches between tests and application code
- Ensuring consistent authentication state across tests
- Managing test database state between test runs

## Conclusion

The foundation for Phase 2 has been successfully implemented with the Unit of Work pattern, standardized responses, and enhanced service implementations. All planned service and API enhancements are now complete, and we've begun implementing comprehensive integration tests to validate the entire system. 

We've now established a solid testing infrastructure that will allow us to verify the correctness of the application as we transition to Phase 4 (ML Implementation). The integration tests will serve as regression tests for future development, ensuring that existing functionality remains working as we add new features.
