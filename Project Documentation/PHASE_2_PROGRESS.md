  - Created `ResponseDto`, `ResponseDto<T>`, and `PagedResponseDto<T>` classes
  - Added helper methods for creating standardized responses
  - Implemented proper error handling and exception translation

- ✅ Base Application Service
  - Created `BaseApplicationService` with common transaction handling
  - Implemented methods for executing operations in transactions
  - Added consistent logging and error handling

- ✅ Validation
  - Enhanced `ValidationException` implementation
  - Added support for property-specific validation errors
  - Created tests for validation functionality

### Service Implementations
- ✅ Enhanced Document Service
  - Implemented `EnhancedDocumentService` using Unit of Work pattern
  - Added transaction handling for all operations
  - Created comprehensive tests for document operations

- ✅ Enhanced Document Type Service
  - Implemented `EnhancedDocumentTypeService` using Unit of Work pattern
  - Added pagination support for document type retrieval
  - Created comprehensive tests for document type operations

### API Layer Enhancements
- ✅ Base API Controller
  - Created `BaseApiController` with standardized response handling
  - Implemented methods for executing API operations with consistent error handling
  - Added comprehensive HTTP status code management

- ✅ Enhanced Document Types Controller
  - Implemented `EnhancedDocumentTypesController` using the new base controller
  - Added proper response formatting with standardized DTOs
  - Added Swagger documentation

## Next Steps

### Service Layer
- [ ] Implement Enhanced User Service
  - Refactor existing user service to use Unit of Work pattern
  - Add proper transaction handling for user operations
  - Create comprehensive tests for user operations

- [ ] File Storage Service Enhancement
  - Implement robust file storage functionality
  - Add support for versioning
  - Add integration with document management

### Data Access Layer
- [ ] Add Pagination Support
  - Implement proper pagination across all repository methods
  - Add response metadata for frontend pagination
  - Create standardized request/response patterns for paged data

### API Layer
- [ ] Complete API Controller Refactoring
  - Refactor remaining controllers to use the base controller
  - Ensure consistent response formats across all endpoints
  - Add comprehensive validation

## Accomplishments

The implementation of the Unit of Work pattern has significantly improved the transaction handling capabilities of the application. We now have a consistent pattern for handling related operations that span multiple repositories, ensuring data integrity.

The standardized response DTOs provide a consistent API contract, making it easier for clients to consume our services. The enhanced error handling and validation will improve the user experience by providing clear feedback on validation issues.

The base application service and controller abstractions have reduced code duplication and improved maintainability by centralizing common concerns like transaction handling, error management, and logging.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Ambiguous Validation Exception**: We encountered an ambiguity issue between our custom `ValidationException` and the system's `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ValidationException`. This was resolved by using fully qualified names or explicit references.

- **Interface Consistency**: We had to ensure that the enhanced service implementations fully respected their interfaces, requiring additional implementations for methods like pagination-enabled document type retrieval.

- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring proper transaction handling, especially in error scenarios, required careful implementation and extensive testing.

## Conclusion

The foundation for Phase 2 has been successfully implemented with the Unit of Work pattern, standardized responses, and enhanced service implementations. This provides a solid base for implementing the remaining Phase 2 features and will make it easier to maintain and extend the application in the future.
